# The Moon 2.0  
A wifi enabled IoT moon, that changes colour when shaken and then transmits that colour to other globes around the world.

## What does it need to do?
The IoT globe needs to:
* be powered by a LiPo battery
* poll ThingSpeak to ascertain current global moon colour
* respond to a shake using an accelerometer by changing to a random colour
* update ThingSpeak with any new colour
